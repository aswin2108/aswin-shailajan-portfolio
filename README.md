# Aswin Shailajan Portfolio Dev

Welcome to my portfolio project which is inspired by Windows Phone Theme.

Local setup :

```
git clone <link>
cd into the repo
npm install
npm start
```

Note: In case you have any difficulty in setting it up, check the node version being used in your system and the one in the project so, and use nvm to manage the version.
Pre-requisite being npm is installed.
